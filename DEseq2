### Set working directory and read in matrix data. In this case, the matrix is a 4hour CMP matrix
setwd("/Users/clair/Documents/HSF/Maize_4h")

fpkm <- read.delim(file= "maize_matrix_txt", head=T, row.names=1)

### Set up the data
# Create dataframe with tissues as conditions
design = data.frame(row.names=colnames(fpkm), condition = c("Maize_4h_heat","Maize_control", "Maize_control", "Maize_4h_heat","Maize_4h_heat","Maize_4h_heat","Maize_4h_heat", "Maize_control", "Maize_control"))
condition = design$condition

# Create count data set varialble within DESeq2
cds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = fpkm,
                              colData = design,
                              design = ~ condition)


# Normalize the data
cds <- estimateSizeFactors(cds)
sizeFactors(cds)

cds <- estimateDispersions(cds)

# Create object with normalized values
norm <- counts(cds, normalized = TRUE)

# Add tissue names to data frame and replace SRA numbers
# create a vector called tissues - take tissues from condition factor in design df (same order as SRA numbers in norm), denote them as a character object using as.character
# use names function to geta set of names from tissues and assign row.names from design (SRA numbers that match each tissue/rep) - now each Tissue is assigned to an SRA number in a vector
# apply tissues as column names of norm
tissues = as.character(design$condition)
names(tissues) = row.names(design)
colnames(norm) = tissues

### Plot correlations of normalized expression levels ###
# Calculate correlations fromt he normalized matrix
cor <- cor(norm, use = "pairwise.complete.obs", method = "spearman")
cor_matrix <- as.matrix(cor,  center = FALSE)

# plot the heatmap
pdf("heatmap.pdf", pointsize=10, font="Helvetica")
heatmap.2(cor_matrix,
          key = TRUE,
          keysize = 0.8,
          density.info = "non",
          trace = "none",
          dendrogram = "row",
          col = "redgreen",
          margin = c(10,10))
dev.off()

# plot the heirarchical tree
dist <- as.dist((1-cor)/2)
pdf(file="tree.pdf", pointsize=9)
plot(hclust(dist))
dev.off()

## Test for DE genes ##
test <- DESeq(cds)

## Write out the test results ##
res <- results(test)

## Pulling out a specific contrast ##
heat_control <- results(test, contrast = c("condition", "Maize_4h_heat","Maize_control"))
nrow(subset(heat_control, padj<0.01 & !(log2FoldChange >= 0.5 & log2FoldChange <= 2)))
write.table(heat_control, file="maize_4h.txt", sep="\t")
